            "description": "UV Stabilizer 622 is an oligomeric hindered amine light stabilizer (HALS) designed to provide long-term UV protection and thermal stability in plastics and coatings. Its high molecular weight ensures low volatility, minimal migration, and excellent extraction resistance, making it particularly suitable for polyolefins, elastomers, and engineering plastics. It is effective in both pigmented and non-pigmented systems and works well with carbon black formulations. The molecular formula (C₁₇H₃₁NO₄)ₙ corresponds to the repeating unit of UV Stabilizer 622, also known as Light Stabilizer 622. This polymeric hindered amine light stabilizer (HALS) is characterized by its high molecular weight, ranging between 3,100 and 4,000 g/mol. Its oligomeric structure ensures low volatility and minimal migration, making it effective in protecting polymers from UV-induced degradation.",

            "description": "UV Stabilizer 783 is a high molecular weight hindered amine light stabilizer (HALS) known for its excellent light stability and long-term thermal stability. It exhibits low volatility, resistance to extraction, and good compatibility with most polymers. This stabilizer is particularly effective in enhancing the durability of polymers exposed to outdoor conditions. UV-783 is a synergistic mixture of UV- 944 and UV-622. It is a versatile UV stabilizer with outstanding extraction resistance, low gasfading and low pigment interaction. UV-783 is particularly well suited for LDPE, LLDPE, HDPE films, tapes and thick sections and for PP in fibers and films. It is also the product of choice for thick sections where indirect food contact approval is required. UV-783 is a versatile UV stabilizer for thin and thick sections and delivers excellent cost / performance benefits. For applications requiring indirect food approvals, TINUVIN 783 can be used at levels not possible with other conventional HALS. The synergism between the two high molecular weight HALS components of UV-783 is an effective stabilization system for the polymer against degradation through UV radiation and long term heat exposure.",

It effectively removes impurities, suspended solids, and organic matter from water, making it suitable for both drinking water and industrial effluent treatment. Additionally, it serves as a precipitant in various chemical processes and is utilized in etching applications in the electronics industry. Naturally occurring as the mineral molysite, it is further utilized in photography, the production of iron salts, pigments, inks, and in the chlorination of silver and copper ores.",
